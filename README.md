## Hey, It's Jack :)

### I bring a passion for creating **ethical AI that solves real-worlds problems** (not just cool tech, but technology that respects people)

## What I’m Working On  
Right now, I’m focused on projects that explore how AI can connect with humans:
| Project | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Emotion-aware chatbot | Reads messages & responds empathetically |
| Fake review detector  | Detects spam or misleading content |
| Personalized learning assistant | Suggests material based on learning style | 

## Tech Stack

## About Me  
I’m studying computer science at **Georgia Tech**, focusing on **Intelligence & People**. To me, AI should do more than impress... it should be responsible, human-centered, and impactful!
