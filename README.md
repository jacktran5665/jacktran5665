## Hey, It's Jack :)

### I bring a passion for creating **ethical AI that solves real-worlds problems** (not just cool tech, but technology that respects people)

## What I’m Working On  
Right now, I’m focused on projects that explore how AI can connect with humans:
- **Emotional aware chatbot – a system that reads user messages and responds empathetically.**  
- **Fake review detector – using AI to spot spam or misleading content online.**  
- **Personalized learning assistant – a tool that suggests study material based on a user’s learning style and progress.**  

## Tech Stack
Python | C# | Java | Assembly  

## About Me  
I’m studying computer science at **Georgia Tech**, focusing on **Intelligence & People**. To me, AI should do more than impress... it should be responsible, human-centered, and impactful!
