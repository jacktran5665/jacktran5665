### Hey, I'm Jack :) I bring a passion for creating **ethical AI that solves real-worlds problems** (not just cool tech, but technology that respects people)

## `What I’m Working On` 
Right now, I’m focused on projects that explore how AI can connect with humans:
| Project | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Emotion-aware chatbot | Reads messages & responds empathetically |
| Fake review detector  | Detects spam or misleading content |
| Personalized learning assistant | Suggests material based on learning style |

## `About Me`  
I’m studying computer science at `Georgia Tech`, focusing on `Intelligence & People`. To me, AI should do more than impress... it should be responsible, human-centered, and impactful! (Lets Connect! [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacktran04/))
